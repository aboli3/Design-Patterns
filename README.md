# Design-Patterns
Design Patterns implemented in C++ (11/23) versions
Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development
Design patterns are primarily based on the following principles of object orientated design :
  1) Program to an interface not an implementation.
  2) Favor object composition over inheritance
23 design patterns which can be classified in three categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral

1)Creational Patterns
  These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. 
  This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
2)Structural Patterns
These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
3)Behavioral Patterns
These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
